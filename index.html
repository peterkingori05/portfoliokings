            <li>
                <strong>SPORTSEQUIPMENTS</strong>: My first ever serious project , it was supposed to be a simple 10 marks assignment but my friends and I took it seriously and thats where our collaboration journey began and the urge to learn and always be in hunger for knowledge. To get to the point <strong>SPORTSEQUIPMENTS</strong>  is a simple website where one can sell different sportsequipments, leave comments, add suggestions of equipments that are not available.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>SPORTSSELECTION</strong>: This was my final project in campus ,at this point I am well versed with almost all the Languages , the structure and flow of different projects .We had a choice to choose what kind of projects we wanted <strong>IOT, WEBSITE, SYSTEMS which i chose, WEBAPP, APPLICATIONS</strong> what inspired me to develop sportsselection system ,I almost forgot I am a sports person so back then when I joined Kabarak the method that was used to take identify sports that freshmen were interested in was manual in that papers were passed around where we wrote our interest and sports , since then I was inspired to deal with that outdated procedure . In sportsselection system you basically <ol>create an account<ol> <ol>choose interests,</ol> choose a sport, <ol> up a profile </ol> there is also an admins page with numerous tasks like approving to join school team request. I can write about the project pages but I would rather let you dive into it and explore.
